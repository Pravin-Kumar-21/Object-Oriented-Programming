// we will study about the types of inheritance ...
/*
1. Single Inheritance
    class A-> class B

2. Multilevel Inheritance 
class A->B->C           // this is a type of multtilevel inheritance 

3. Hierrachial Inheritance 
class A-> class B
           ->class C
           ->class D
more than one derived class associated with a single parent class or base class is an example of hierarchial Inheritance

4. Multiple Inheritance 
    class A ->Class D
    class B ->Class D
    class C ->Class D

    A derived class having more than one parent class or base class is called a Mutilple Inheritance .
